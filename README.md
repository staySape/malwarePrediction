# Capstone Background

The goal of this dataset is to predict a Windows machineâ€™s probability of getting infected by various families of malware, based on different properties of that machine. The telemetry data containing these properties and the machine infections was generated by combining heartbeat and threat reports collected by Microsoft's endpoint protection solution, Windows Defender.

# Information about the data

The training set has 8.9 million rows and 83 columns. The datasets has columns describing machine's characteristics and if it has detections or not.

# Reason for choosing this data

I chose this data since I would like to know more on how statistical or machine learning techniques can be applied in predicting malware detection or infection rate.
